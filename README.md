# ðŸš€ Rahul's Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! I am continously enhancing my skills through a range of data-driven projects, focusing on the following areas:
- SQL, Python, and R for data manipulation and analysis.
- Power BI, Tableau, and Excel for data visualization and reporting.

<h1>Projects</h1>

Using Tableau for visualisations and SQL/Python for data processing, it uncovers insights into how different brands, products, and regions contributed to the companyâ€™s success and provides recommendations for future growth strategies.
